# Goose CLI Integration - AI PM Exploration Toolkit

## Native AI Agent for Product Management

Goose CLI provides autonomous AI analysis with direct access to all toolkit files. Unlike external AI consultations, Goose can examine your actual implementation, run commands, and provide multi-step strategic analysis.

## Quick Start

### Basic PM Strategy Session
```bash
# Start a focused PM strategy analysis session
goose session --name pm_strategy_analysis

# Once in session, describe your challenge:
"Analyze the current state of the AI PM toolkit and recommend strategic improvements for product managers who need to de-risk feature decisions"
```

### Specific Analysis Sessions
```bash
# Technical feasibility assessment
goose session --name feasibility_check

# Competitive analysis and market research  
goose session --name competitor_analysis

# Feature prioritization support
goose session --name feature_prioritization

# User research synthesis
goose session --name user_research_analysis
```

## PM-Specific Goose Prompts

### Strategic Decision Support
```
"I need to decide whether to build [FEATURE] or focus on [ALTERNATIVE]. 

Analyze the toolkit's capabilities to:
1. Generate synthetic user data for both options
2. Model usage scenarios and edge cases  
3. Assess technical complexity using available AI tools
4. Provide a recommendation with supporting evidence

Consider our PM philosophy of using the cheapest prototype that tells the harshest truth."
```

### Risk Assessment Framework
```
"Help me identify the top risks in [PLAN] and design PoL probes to test each risk.

Use the toolkit to:
1. Generate synthetic scenarios that stress-test assumptions
2. Analyze historical data patterns for similar features
3. Create feasibility spikes that validate core technical assumptions
4. Design narrative prototypes that expose user experience risks

Provide specific next steps with timeline and resource estimates."
```

### Stakeholder Presentation Preparation
```
"I need to present [PROPOSAL] to executives next week.

Help me create compelling evidence by:
1. Processing any user research audio files for key insights
2. Generating supporting synthetic data that models success scenarios  
3. Creating competitive analysis showing market opportunity
4. Building a business case with realistic assumptions

Focus on 'show before tell' - tangible proofs over abstract benefits."
```

### User Research Synthesis
```
"I have multiple user interviews and survey data that need strategic analysis.

Use the toolkit to:
1. Process audio transcriptions for pattern identification
2. Generate additional synthetic users to expand sample size
3. Create user personas based on combined real + synthetic data
4. Identify feature opportunities and prioritization frameworks
5. Build actionable recommendations for product roadmap

Connect insights to our PoL probe methodology for next steps."
```

## Advanced Goose Workflows

### Multi-Modal Analysis Pipeline
```bash
goose session --name comprehensive_analysis

# In session:
"Execute a complete PM analysis pipeline:
1. Audio processing of user interviews
2. Synthetic data generation for validation  
3. Competitive research on key players
4. AI chat analysis for strategic frameworks
5. Integration of all findings into executive summary"
```

### Automated Assumption Testing
```bash
goose session --name assumption_testing

# In session:
"Design and execute assumption tests for [HYPOTHESIS]:
1. Create synthetic data scenarios that model the assumption
2. Run feasibility checks using AI tools
3. Generate edge cases that could break the assumption
4. Provide probability assessment and risk mitigation strategies"
```

### Toolkit Enhancement Recommendations  
```bash
goose session --name toolkit_improvement

# In session:
"Analyze the current toolkit implementation and recommend:
1. Missing tools that would improve PM workflow efficiency
2. Integration opportunities between existing tools
3. Performance optimizations for faster PoL probe creation
4. New PoL probe types that would address common PM challenges"
```

## Session Management Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- **pm_strategy_[topic]** - Strategic analysis sessions
- **feasibility_[feature]** - Technical feasibility assessments
- **research_[area]** - User research and market analysis
- **planning_[quarter]** - Roadmap and prioritization sessions

### Session Documentation
```bash
# Save important sessions for team sharing
goose session --name pm_q2_planning --save

# Resume previous analysis  
goose session --name pm_q2_planning --resume

# Export findings for stakeholder presentations
goose session --name competitive_analysis --export analysis_report.md
```

### Collaboration Workflows
```bash
# Share session state with team members
goose session --name feature_analysis --share team@company.com

# Collaborative analysis across multiple PM sessions
goose session --name team_strategy --multi-user
```

## Integration with Toolkit Tools

### Combining Goose with Web Dashboard
1. **Use web interface** for quick data generation and audio processing
2. **Switch to Goose** for strategic analysis of generated outputs
3. **Return to web** for final presentation formatting and export

### Goose + VS Code Workflow
1. **Goose analysis** provides strategic direction and recommendations
2. **VS Code + Continue** handles implementation details and code generation  
3. **Goose validation** ensures implementation aligns with strategic goals

### Goose + External AI Consultation
1. **Goose deep dive** generates comprehensive analysis using toolkit data
2. **Export findings** to external AI (Claude/ChatGPT) for strategic refinement
3. **Iterate between** local autonomous analysis and external strategic guidance

## Performance and Privacy Benefits

### Local Processing Advantages
- **Complete Privacy**: All analysis happens on your machine
- **No API Rate Limits**: Unlimited queries and analysis depth
- **Direct File Access**: Can examine proprietary data and configurations
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet connection after setup

### Speed and Efficiency
- **Parallel Analysis**: Can run multiple toolkit tools simultaneously
- **Cached Results**: Reuses analysis across related questions
- **Incremental Updates**: Builds on previous session findings
- **Resource Optimization**: Uses local AI models efficiently

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Session Startup Problems
```bash
# Check Goose installation
goose --version

# Verify toolkit access
goose session --name test_access
"Can you see the AI PM Exploration Toolkit files?"
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Use specific session focus to improve response speed
goose session --name focused_analysis --scope /path/to/specific/directory

# Limit context for faster responses
goose session --name quick_check --lightweight
```

### Integration Issues
```bash
# Test toolkit command execution
goose session --name command_test
"Run python3 shared/data_generator.py --help to verify toolkit access"
```
