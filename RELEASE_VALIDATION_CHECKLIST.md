# AI PM Toolkit - Release Validation Checklist ✅

## ⚠️  MANDATORY PRE-RELEASE VALIDATION

**NO RELEASES WITHOUT COMPLETING THIS CHECKLIST**

This checklist exists because bugs damaged your reputation in user groups. Every item must be verified as ✅ **WORKING** before any release, demo, or public announcement.

## 🎯 VALIDATION PRINCIPLES

1. **Zero Tolerance for Broken Promises** - If we document it, it must work
2. **User-First Testing** - Test from new user perspective, not developer perspective  
3. **Evidence-Based Validation** - Screenshots, logs, and specific output required
4. **Systematic Coverage** - Every feature, every command, every URL tested
5. **Manual Human Verification** - Automated tests miss user experience issues

## 🚨 CRITICAL RELEASE BLOCKERS

**Any ONE of these failing blocks release:**

- [ ] **Installer fails or doesn't complete cleanly**
- [ ] **Any aipm_* command returns "command not found"**  
- [ ] **Any promised localhost URL returns 404 or connection refused**
- [ ] **Web dashboard shows template errors or broken CSS**
- [ ] **Core audio transcription feature completely non-functional**
- [ ] **AI chat system returns no responses or crashes**
- [ ] **Help documentation promises features that don't work**

## 🧪 PRE-VALIDATION SETUP

### Environment Reset (MANDATORY)

Complete nuclear reset before validation testing:

```bash
# 1. CRITICAL: Stop ALL services before any testing
echo "🛑 STOPPING ALL SERVICES..."
sudo lsof -ti:3000,5678,7860,8082,8888 | xargs sudo kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
docker stop $(docker ps -aq) 2>/dev/null || true
pkill ollama 2>/dev/null || true

# 2. Remove all AIPM environment configs
sed -i '' '/aipm/d' ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc 2>/dev/null || true
sed -i '' '/AI PM Toolkit/d' ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc 2>/dev/null || true
find ~ -name "aipm-env.sh" -delete 2>/dev/null || true

# 3. Fresh shell session
exec $SHELL

# 4. Verify clean state
type aipm_dashboard 2>/dev/null && echo "❌ ENVIRONMENT NOT CLEAN" || echo "✅ Clean environment ready"

# 5. CRITICAL: Verify all ports are free before installation
for port in 3000 5678 7860 8082 8888; do
    lsof -ti:$port >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "❌ BLOCKER: Port $port occupied" || echo "✅ Port $port free"
done
```

### Fresh Installation Required

**IMPORTANT: These commands must be run OUTSIDE the existing project directory**

```bash
# Navigate to a separate location (NOT inside ai-pm-exploration-toolkit)
cd ~/Desktop  # or any location outside the project

# Clone fresh copy for validation testing
git clone https://github.com/deanpeters/ai-pm-exploration-toolkit.git validation-test
cd validation-test

# Verify we're in the correct directory structure
pwd  # Should show something like: /Users/yourname/Desktop/validation-test
ls -la core/ web/ src/  # Should show the project structure

# CRITICAL: Verify ports are free before installer (prevents hanging)
echo "🔍 FINAL PORT CHECK BEFORE INSTALLER..."
for port in 3000 5678 7860 8082 8888; do
    if lsof -ti:$port >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "❌ CRITICAL BLOCKER: Port $port occupied - STOP INSTALLATION"
        echo "Kill process first: sudo lsof -ti:$port | xargs sudo kill -9"
        exit 1
    fi
done

# Run installer exactly as new user would
python3 core/installer.py

**Remember:** This checklist exists because broken promises destroy user trust and damage reputations. Take the time to validate thoroughly - it's always faster than dealing with frustrated users and damaged credibility.

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

**NO SHORTCUTS. NO EXCEPTIONS. NO BROKEN PROMISES.**

Every release must pass this validation completely. The reputation damage from rushing releases is far more costly than the time spent on thorough validation.
