# Contributing to AI PM Exploration Toolkit

Welcome! We're excited that you want to contribute to the AI PM Exploration Toolkit. This guide will help you submit tools that align with our **4E Framework** and serve **product managers** who need **Proof-of-Life Probes** to de-risk decisions.

## 🎯 Our Mission

Transform product managers from AI-curious to AI-confident through the **4E Framework**:
- **🎓 Education**: Personal AI classroom for safe learning
- **🧪 Experimentation**: Evidence over opinion with synthetic data  
- **🔍 Exploration**: Discovery without limits using 40+ tools
- **📊 Explanation**: Show before tell, touch before sell

## 🛡️ Core Principles

1. **Privacy-First**: Core functionality runs 100% offline
2. **PM Focus**: Tools must serve product managers specifically
3. **4E Framework Alignment**: Every tool must clearly support the learning journey
4. **Proof-of-Life Methodology**: Enable lightweight, disposable, brutally honest probes
5. **Quality Over Quantity**: High-value tools that integrate seamlessly
