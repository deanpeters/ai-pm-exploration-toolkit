# VS Code + Continue Integration - AI PM Exploration Toolkit

## Native AI-Assisted Development for Product Managers

VS Code with the Continue extension provides seamless AI assistance directly in your development environment. Unlike external AI consultations, Continue has full context of your toolkit files and can help with both strategic analysis and implementation.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Open Toolkit in VS Code
```bash
# Open the entire toolkit in VS Code
code /Users/deanpeters/ai-pm-exploration-toolkit

# Or open specific project areas
code /Users/deanpeters/ai-pm-exploration-toolkit/experiments
code /Users/deanpeters/ai-pm-exploration-toolkit/prototypes
```

### 2. Continue Extension Shortcuts
Once VS Code is open with the Continue extension installed:

- **Ctrl+I (⌘+I on Mac)**: Ask Continue about implementation details
- **Ctrl+L (⌘+L on Mac)**: Start strategic chat with AI assistant  
- **Ctrl+K (⌘+K on Mac)**: Generate PM documentation and analysis
- **Ctrl+⇧+I**: Explain selected code in PM context
