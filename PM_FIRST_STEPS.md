## Your First Learning Win: 5-Minute AI Collaboration

Let's start with something familiar: **thinking through a product idea**. You'll learn how to collaborate with AI as a thinking partner, not just a tool.

### Step 1: Open Your AI Assistant
The toolkit installed an AI assistant called `aider`. Think of it as **ChatGPT that can create files for you**.

1. **Open Terminal** (don't worry, we'll keep this simple)
2. **Type this command and press Enter:**
   ```bash
   aider
   ```

**What just happened?** You started your personal AI assistant. It's running locally on your computer‚Äîno data leaves your machine.

### Step 2: Create Your First Product Brief
Let's create a one-page brief for a new feature idea. Tell your AI assistant:

> "Create a one-page product brief for a new feature called 'Smart Meeting Summaries'. Include sections for Problem Statement, Proposed Solution, Target Users, and Success Metrics. Make it concise and stakeholder-ready."

**Watch the magic:** Your AI will create a complete document file for you. No more blank page syndrome!

### Step 3: Refine It
Now iterate like you would with any team member:

> "Make the Problem Statement more urgent. Add a section about competitive differentiation."

**Boom.** You just used AI to draft, refine, and structure a product brief in under 5 minutes.

## Your Second Win: Competitive Intelligence in 30 Seconds

Let's gather some competitive intel using AI-powered research.

### Step 1: Ask Your AI Research Assistant
```bash
aipm_research_quick "What are the top 3 competitive threats to Notion in the workspace productivity market?"
```

**What happens:** An AI researcher will scan the web, analyze multiple sources, and give you a structured competitive analysis.

### Step 2: Get Financial Data on a Competitor
```bash
aipm_company_lookup TEAM
```

**What happens:** You'll get financial metrics, recent news, and business intelligence on TeamViewer (or any public company) in seconds.

## Your Third Win: Visual Workflow Without Code

Let's create a workflow that automates something you do manually‚Äîlike tracking competitor announcements.

### Step 1: Open Your Workflow Builder
```bash
aipm_workflows
```

This opens a visual tool called n8n. **Think of it as Zapier, but more powerful and running on your computer.**

### Step 2: Create Your First Automation
1. **Click "Add workflow"**
2. **Add an RSS trigger** - paste in a competitor's blog RSS feed
3. **Add a Slack action** - connect to your workspace
4. **Connect them** - now you'll get alerts whenever your competitor posts

**Result:** You just automated competitive intelligence monitoring without writing a single line of code.

## One More Thing: When You Get Stuck

**Remember:** You're not trying to become a developer. You're using developer tools to become a better product manager.

- **Confused by a command?** Most start with `aipm_` - just type `aipm_help` for a list
- **Tool not working?** Try `aipm_status` to check what's running
- **Want to see what's possible?** Type `aipm_demo` for interactive examples

**You've got this.** Every successful PM tool you use (Figma, Notion, Miro) started as something technical. This toolkit just gives you superpowers before they become mainstream.
