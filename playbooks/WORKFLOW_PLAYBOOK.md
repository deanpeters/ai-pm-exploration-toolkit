# Visual Workflow Suite: Build Prototypes Without Code

This suite allows for building prototypes and automation without code. The progression moves from simple event-based automation to visual AI chaining, ending with full internal tool creation.

**The PM Superpower:** Create working demonstrations of complex workflows that stakeholders can actually use, without waiting for engineering resources.

## What the Visual Workflow Suite Does for Product Managers

**Think of these as:**
- **n8n** = Zapier Pro (but more powerful and private)
- **Langflow** = Visual AI logic builder (drag-and-drop intelligence)
- **ToolJet** = Internal tool builder (create dashboards in hours, not months)
- **Typebot** = Conversational UX designer (build chatbots visually)

**Real PM Use Cases:**
- Automate competitive intelligence gathering
- Build AI-powered product demos for stakeholder meetings
- Create internal dashboards for team metrics
- Prototype conversational interfaces for user research
- Connect disparate tools and data sources
- Build "wizard of oz" experiments to test product concepts

## Troubleshooting

### "The tools won't start"
```bash
# Check if Docker is running
docker --version

# Restart the workflow tools
aipm_workflows_restart
```

### "I can't connect to the web interfaces"
- **Check the ports:** n8n (5678), Langflow (7860), ToolJet (8082), Typebot (8083)
- **Wait a few minutes:** Tools need time to fully start
- **Try `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1`**

### "My workflows aren't saving"
- **Check disk space:** These tools store data locally
- **Ensure Docker has enough memory:** At least 4GB recommended
- **Don't close browser tabs while saving**

### "The AI responses are inconsistent"
- **Lower the temperature:** Use 0.1-0.3 for consistent outputs
- **Improve your prompts:** Be more specific about desired format
- **Add examples:** Show the AI what good output looks like
