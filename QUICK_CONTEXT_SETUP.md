# Quick Context Setup - 30-Second AI Consultation

## For External AI Systems (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini)

### Step 1: Upload Context Files (15 seconds)
Drag and drop these 6 files into your AI conversation:

1. **AI_CONSULTATION_CONTEXT.md** - Strategic overview and philosophy
2. **TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md** - Architecture and implementation details  
3. **CONSULTATION_TEMPLATES.md** - Ready-to-use prompts for common scenarios
4. **TOOLKIT_CONFIG_REFERENCE.json** - System configuration and tool capabilities
5. **SAMPLE_OUTPUTS.md** - Real examples of toolkit outputs and results
6. **QUICK_CONTEXT_SETUP.md** - This setup guide

### Step 2: Choose Your Consultation Template (10 seconds)
Pick from CONSULTATION_TEMPLATES.md based on your immediate need:

- **Feasibility Check** - Technical risk assessment before development
- **User Research Analysis** - Strategic insights from interview data
- **Competitive Intelligence** - Rapid market analysis and positioning  
- **Feature Prioritization** - Evidence-based roadmap decisions
- **Executive Presentation** - Compelling business case preparation
- **Strategy Session** - Structured decision-making frameworks

### Step 3: Customize and Ask (5 seconds)
Replace the bracketed placeholders in your chosen template with your specific context and paste into the AI conversation.

## Example Quick Start

### Immediate Feasibility Check
```
I need to evaluate [FEATURE IDEA] technical feasibility.

Based on the AI PM Exploration Toolkit context:
- What's the cheapest PoL probe to test this?
- What are the highest-risk unknowns?  
- How can I use synthetic data to model edge cases?
- What would a 1-2 day spike look like?

Context: [YOUR FEATURE DETAILS]
Tech stack: [YOUR STACK]
Timeline: [DECISION DEADLINE]
```

## Alternative Setup Options

### For Goose CLI Users (Local AI Agent)
```bash
# Start autonomous analysis session
goose session --name pm_strategy_analysis

# Goose has direct access to all toolkit files
# Just describe your challenge and let it analyze
```

### For VS Code + Continue Users
```bash
# Open toolkit in VS Code
code /path/to/ai-pm-exploration-toolkit

# Use Continue shortcuts:
# Ctrl+I: Implementation questions
# Ctrl+L: Strategic discussions  
# Ctrl+K: Documentation generation
```

### For Visual Documentation (MarkText)
```bash
# Beautiful markdown reading experience (requires MarkText installation)
open -a MarkText AI_CONSULTATION_CONTEXT.md

# Or use the aipm_marktext alias if setup.sh was run
aipm_marktext AI_CONSULTATION_CONTEXT.md
```

## What You Get

### Immediate Strategic Guidance
- **PoL Probe recommendations** tailored to your specific challenge
- **Risk assessment frameworks** for decision-making
- **Implementation approaches** based on toolkit capabilities
- **Success metrics** aligned with product management best practices

### Follow-up Analysis Options
- **Deep-dive technical feasibility** using toolkit's AI models
- **Synthetic data generation** for assumption testing
- **Competitive research** with market intelligence tools
- **Audio analysis** for user research insights

## Success Indicators

You'll know the consultation is working when:
- **Clear next steps** emerge within first 5 minutes
- **Specific PoL probe designs** address your core assumptions
- **Risk mitigation strategies** feel actionable and realistic  
- **Decision frameworks** provide structure for team discussions

## Common Use Cases (With Templates)

### Quick Decision Support
"Should we build [FEATURE] or focus on [ALTERNATIVE]?"
→ Use **Feature Prioritization Template**

### Risk Assessment  
"What could go wrong with [PLAN]?"
→ Use **Feasibility Check Template**

### Stakeholder Preparation
"How do I convince executives [PROPOSAL] is worth pursuing?"
→ Use **Executive Presentation Template**

### User Insight Analysis
"What do these user interviews tell us about [PRODUCT AREA]?"
→ Use **User Research Analysis Template**

### Competitive Intelligence
"How does [COMPETITOR] approach [PROBLEM] and what can we learn?"
→ Use **Competitive Intelligence Template**

## Pro Tips

### Maximize AI Assistance
- **Be specific** about your constraints (time, resources, stakeholders)
- **Include context** about your product, users, and market
- **Ask for examples** when frameworks feel too abstract
- **Request follow-up questions** to deepen the analysis

### Leverage Toolkit Integration  
- **Reference specific tools** mentioned in the technical specification
- **Ask about local AI capabilities** for privacy-sensitive analysis
- **Explore workflow automation** options for repetitive tasks
- **Consider multi-modal approaches** (audio + data + competitive research)

### Iterate Effectively
- **Start broad** with strategic questions, then narrow to specifics
- **Test assumptions** with synthetic data before real user research
- **Validate frameworks** with small experiments before big commitments
- **Document insights** for future strategic discussions

**Remember:** This is designed for reconnaissance missions that de-risk assumptions before committing engineering resources. Focus on learning speed over implementation perfection.

**Key Question:** What's the cheapest prototype that tells the harshest truth about your current challenge?
