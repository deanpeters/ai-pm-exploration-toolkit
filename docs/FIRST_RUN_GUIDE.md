## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Commands don't work"
- **Restart your terminal completely**
- **Check shell configuration:** `echo $SHELL` should show your shell type
- **Manual source:** `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc`

### "Docker tools won't start"  
- **Open Docker Desktop** and wait for green status indicator
- **Check memory:** Docker needs at least 4GB RAM allocated
- **Restart Docker** if containers seem stuck

### "AI tools give errors"
- **Most tools work offline** - no internet required
- **Some features need API keys** - these are clearly marked as optional
- **Python version:** The toolkit works with Python 3.11+ (you likely have 3.13)

### "Need help with specific tools"
- **Check the playbooks** in the `playbooks/` directory
- **Use command help:** Most commands show usage when run without arguments
- **Start simple:** Focus on basic AI collaboration before advanced features
