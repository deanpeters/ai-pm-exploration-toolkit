# Consultation Templates - Ready-to-Use AI Prompts

## Strategic Product Management Consultation Prompts

Copy and paste these templates into Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini after uploading the context files.

### 1. Feasibility Check Template

```
I need to evaluate the technical feasibility of [FEATURE/IDEA] before committing engineering resources.

Based on the AI PM Exploration Toolkit context:
- What's the cheapest PoL probe I can build to test this assumption?
- What are the highest-risk technical unknowns?
- How can I use synthetic data to model edge cases?
- What would a 1-2 day spike-and-delete test look like?

Context: [DESCRIBE YOUR FEATURE/IDEA HERE]
Current tech stack: [YOUR STACK]
Team constraints: [RESOURCES/TIMELINE]
```

### 2. User Research Analysis Template

```
I have user interview data that needs strategic analysis for product decisions.

Using the Audio Intelligence approach from the toolkit:
- Extract the top 3 pain points that could drive feature prioritization
- Identify any feature requests that contradict our current roadmap
- Find patterns that suggest new market opportunities
- Generate specific user personas based on the interview insights

Raw data: [PASTE TRANSCRIPTS OR UPLOAD AUDIO FILES]
Current product focus: [YOUR PRODUCT AREA]
Decision timeline: [WHEN YOU NEED INSIGHTS]
```

### 3. Competitive Intelligence Template

```
I need rapid competitive analysis for strategic planning discussions.

Based on the market research capabilities in the toolkit:
- Analyze [COMPETITOR NAME]'s business model and positioning
- Identify their key differentiators and potential vulnerabilities  
- Map their feature set against our roadmap
- Suggest defensive or offensive strategic moves

Industry context: [YOUR INDUSTRY]
Specific concerns: [WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT]
Strategic goals: [WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE]
```

### 4. Feature Prioritization Template

```
I need to prioritize features for our next quarter using evidence over opinion.

Using the synthetic data and strategic analysis approach:
- Generate 50 user personas for our target market
- Model how different user types would respond to each feature
- Create impact/effort scoring based on realistic assumptions
- Identify which features are "must-have" vs "nice-to-have"

Feature candidates: [LIST YOUR OPTIONS]
Success metrics: [WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE]
Resource constraints: [TEAM SIZE/TIMELINE]
```

### 5. Executive Presentation Preparation Template

```
I need to present an AI/ML feature proposal to executives and need compelling evidence.

Based on the "Show Before Tell" philosophy:
- Create a narrative prototype that demonstrates the user value
- Generate supporting data that shows market demand
- Identify the key risks and our mitigation strategies
- Build a business case with realistic assumptions

Proposed feature: [DESCRIBE YOUR IDEA]
Executive audience: [WHO YOU'RE PRESENTING TO]
Success criteria: [WHAT APPROVAL LOOKS LIKE]
```

### 6. Strategy Session Facilitation Template

```
I'm leading a strategy session and need structured frameworks for decision-making.

Using the AI strategic thinking partner approach:
- Create discussion frameworks for evaluating options
- Generate devil's advocate questions for each proposal
- Provide decision-making templates that reduce bias
- Suggest follow-up experiments to validate assumptions

Session topic: [WHAT YOU'RE DECIDING]
Stakeholders: [WHO'S INVOLVED]
Decision timeline: [WHEN YOU NEED RESOLUTION]
```

## Proof-of-Life Probe Specific Prompts

### Narrative Prototype Creation

```
Help me create a narrative prototype for [FEATURE] that earns stakeholder "hell yes" responses.

Requirements:
- Focus on user value, not technical implementation
- Include realistic user scenarios and pain points
- Show the before/after transformation clearly
- Make it compelling enough to justify engineering investment

Target audience: [INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS]
User context: [WHO BENEFITS]
Success measure: [WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE]
```

### Synthetic Data Simulation Design

```
I need to model [SCENARIO/SYSTEM] behavior without risking production systems.

Design a synthetic data simulation that:
- Tests our assumptions about user behavior
- Models edge cases we haven't encountered
- Provides quantitative evidence for decision-making
- Runs on the local AI infrastructure described in the toolkit

Assumptions to test: [LIST YOUR HYPOTHESES]
Key metrics: [WHAT TO MEASURE]
Edge cases: [WHAT COULD GO WRONG]
```

### Vibe-Coded Probe Planning

```
Help me design a vibe-coded probe for [CONCEPT] that captures authentic user signals.

Parameters:
- Fake frontend with enough fidelity to feel real
- Semi-plausible backend that handles core interactions
- Just enough illusion to catch genuine user responses
- Clear success/failure criteria for the experiment

Target users: [WHO YOU'RE TESTING WITH]
Core interaction: [WHAT USERS WILL DO]
Success metrics: [HOW YOU'LL KNOW IT WORKS]
```

## Integration-Specific Templates

### For Native Goose CLI Users

```
I'm using Goose CLI for autonomous analysis of the AI PM toolkit.

Goose session focus: [WHAT YOU WANT ANALYZED]
Expected deliverables: [WHAT OUTPUT YOU NEED]
Analysis depth: [SURFACE-LEVEL OR DEEP-DIVE]
Time constraint: [HOW QUICKLY YOU NEED RESULTS]

Let Goose analyze the toolkit files directly and provide strategic recommendations.
```

### For VS Code + Continue Users

```
I'm working in VS Code with Continue extension and need AI assistance.

Current file context: [WHAT YOU'RE WORKING ON]
Specific challenge: [WHAT YOU'RE STUCK ON]
Integration goal: [WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD]
Code quality requirements: [PRODUCTION VS PROTOTYPE]

Use Continue's local AI models to provide contextual help.
```

## Quick Response Templates

### 30-Second Strategy Check
"Based on the toolkit approach, is [DECISION] aligned with PoL probe principles? What's the harshest truth this decision might reveal?"

### Rapid Assumption Test
"What's the cheapest way to test the assumption that [HYPOTHESIS] using the tools in the AI PM toolkit?"

### Stakeholder Translation
"How do I explain [TECHNICAL CONCEPT] to executives using the 'Show Before Tell' approach from the toolkit?"

### Risk Assessment
"What are the top 3 ways [PLAN] could fail, and what PoL probes would catch those failures early?"
